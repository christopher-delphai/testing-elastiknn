# testing-elastiknn
This repository contains some code to test the elastiknn-plugin for Elasticsearch, see here: https://github.com/alexklibisz/elastiknn

Basically it's just taking word vectors from a word2vec model and adding some random vectors as well to perform some load tests. It's based on release 0.1.0-PRE39 which works with Elasticsearch 7.6.2. (https://github.com/alexklibisz/elastiknn/releases/tag/0.1.0-PRE39)

For the setup see the official documentation here: https://elastiknn.com/installation/

And API explanations are provided here: https://elastiknn.com/api/
